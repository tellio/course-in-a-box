## Create a Learning Community that Lasts

My experience with online "courses" have been a mixed bag.  I have enjoyed much success in MOOCs with the great aid of other facilitators. Trying to replicate those cMOOCs in hybrid or in Blackboard online courses, has proven difficult.  This course must become a community in a box.  How do we do that?  Let's work together on that.

Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It's hard to feel invested
in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q &amp; A forums where you
don't know anyone.

In a stellar learning experience, you'd know who was in the room and feel super-comfy.
You'd make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You'd want to send people
thank-you cards and chicken soup.

We know designing a creative, participatory community can be tricky. We're here to help
you craft assignments that rule, build an audience and support you along the way. You'll
even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry, 1s and 0s wash off
pretty easily.
		
## OK, but who are you guys?

We're [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--we build learning communities
on the web. In the last 5 years, we put together courses like 
[Play With Your Music](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/),
[Learning Creative Learning](http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), the
[Deeper Learning MOOC](http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/), and
[A Gentle Intro to Python](http://mechanicalmooc.org/). 
Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
